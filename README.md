### grunt

a Jack-Of-All-Trades Go package to interact with arbitrary data used in most web applications 
dealing with forms and data.  This is not a binding library, rather simple utils to sanitize and
coerce data.  This is a work in progress, will add methods as-needed during the development of 
several production go web apps.  Feel free to fork and pull request to add some love.

### About The Name

I know grunt is the name of a popular nodejs build tool.  Grunt is also an alias for infantry 
soldiers, of which I'm an alumn and thus the name is my tribute to those who understand this 
package is the 550 cord & 100 mile-an-hour tape of go web development.
